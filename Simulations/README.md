## Multiplex Shock Code

This is code to analyze how the experiment multiplex networks evolve after shocks. 

We want to especially thank Paul Smaldino for creating the initial code we base our simulations on. Code is from paper: Smaldino PE, Dâ€™Souza R, Maoz Z Resilience by structural entrenchment: Dynamics of single-layer and multiplex networks following sudden changes to tie costs. Network Science: 1-19. doi:10.1017/nws.2017.35 (2017).

Outline of our code:

AgentsSimulation.java: this is where we can vary simulation parameters, make a filename for the output, and list how many timesteps we record in the output file Data.java: this is where we vary what data is recorded GamePlayerAgent.java: this is where we code how agents behave when it is there turn to add/drop links Agent.java: this is the meat of the code, where we code how agents add, drop, and rewire links, as well as accept links offered to them. GraphicalUI.java: this is where we can see how the network updates in real time. This is legacy code and is currently defunct (but can work with slight modifications we hope to do in the future). What agents do: Each agent is on a 2-layer multiplex network. They can connect to up to N other agents, but when offering ties, search among m=10 agents. If run as-is the m agents are picked at random, but we also allow for agents to be chosen in a "smarter" fashion and see the same qualitative results.

If it is not their turn and a tie is offered to them:

Probability p: accept link and probability 1-p: accept link only if it increases their utility If it is their turn:

Iterate N times for each agent (where N is the number of agents):
  Probability p: The agent picks a random node in a random layer, and deletes a link if there is one and offers a link if there is not one 
  Probability 1-p: The agent either adds or drops a link, whichever increases utility most.
  
e, b, c_i, and d are parameters (b=1 for now)

v_i are the number of edges that are the same across layers ("spillover" edges) for node i. These edges are seen more often than chance in real systems. t_{i,l} are the number of edges from node i in each layer (edges are undirected). There is a benefit (bt_{i,l}) and associated cost (c_it_{i,l}^2) for each tie z_{i,l} are the number of triangles made by node i. This is used to create clustering seen in cooperative (as well as many other) networks Agents can either maximize u_i at each timestep or rewire, which allows agents to "explore". This is intuitively similar to the epsilon-greedy algorithm in Multi-Armed Bandit theory, or alike to temperature in simulated annealing. In either case, this randomness allows agents to explore the system more than they otherwise would, which in a rough utility landscape, allows them to find unexpected ways their utility can be maximized.
