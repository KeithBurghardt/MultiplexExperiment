## Requires: 
Pandas (converts hard-to-parse csv files into easy-to-parse csv files)

## Files
- ParseExperimentData.py reads in all data that we output from z-Tree and converts it into an easy-to-read .csv file
- ParseSimulationData.py reads in the raw output of the simulation and converts it into a slightly different easy-to-read .csv file
