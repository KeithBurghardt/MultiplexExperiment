Code by Keith Burghardt (Copyright 2018)

The repository is split into 3 parts: experiment code, simulations and data analysis
 - Experiment code is Z-Tree code based on code from the paper: Martijn J Burger and Vincent Buskens. "Social context and network formation: An experimental study" Social Networks 31(1):63â€“75 (2009)
 - Simulations are Java code based on code by Paul Smaldino here: https://www.comses.net/codebases/5148/releases/1.0.0/. Description of simulation algorithm is in our forthcoming paper.
 - Data analysis is python code that reads in the raw output of the simulation and experiment data and spits out a user-friendly .csv file
